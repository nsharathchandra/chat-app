<h2> Used: </h2>
<p> React, GraphQL, Module Federation </p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>First, you need to install all the dependencies by changing directory to client, home-page and server folders. This looks something like</p>
<ul>
<li>cd client </li>
<li> yarn </li>
<li>cd ..</li>
<li>cd client </li>
<li> yarn </li>
<li>cd client </li>
<li> yarn </li>
</ul>

<h2> Available Scripts </h2>
<p>In the project directory head to the client folder and run: </p>
<h3>yarn start </h3>
<p>The client will be running at http://localhost:8080/ </p>
<p>Now open another terminal and keeping current directory as home-page, run: </p>
<h3>yarn start </h3>
<p>This will create another user and will be running at http://localhost:8081/ </p>
<p>If more users need to be added, just open more terminals and keeping current directory as home-page, run: </p>
<h3>yarn start </h3>
<p>You should be able to type messages between multiple users to see the chat-app working real time. </p>
